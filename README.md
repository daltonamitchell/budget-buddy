# Budget Buddy

Budget Buddy is a little application I'm building to easily track income & expenses. It's built using Javascript and it's awesome!

## Why?

I was inspired to build this app after using several apps in the personal finance space. While each had unique strengths, no one product provided all the key features I needed to stay on track with my budget.

Here are a few key features I plan to include:

* **Easily and quickly add and categorize items** - Who wants to spend all day adding transactions?
* **Customize view to your specific needs** - So you can focus on the data that matters most to you!
* **Clear indication when you're over budget for the month, as well as week or even day.**
* **Easily share with others** - Share your budget with your whole family to help you stay on track!

## Technology

I'll be building this using a variation of the [MEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle) stack, replacing Angular with Ember. I think Javascript [SPA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) work particularly well for applications like this where you want detailed analysis of your finances and the ability to quickly see how things change over time. I've also found that [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) in general, are great for modeling financial data, which, while essentially being numeric data, represents additional information not easily conveyed by numbers.

## Live / Demo version
